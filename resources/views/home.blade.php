<h1> Welcome to my site! </h1>

    <h2>Why do you have it?</h2>
    <p>Honestly? Just because I want to have it! I`m here to be joyous and whimsical and.. Make something I can be proud of!</p>
    <h2>Will you add XYZ?</h2>
    <p>Probably not.</p>
    <h2>What can I find on here?</h2>
    <p>Not much, at the moment! But perhaps in the future, you can learn about me. You can learn of my projects. You can learn of my interests. This is my corner of the internet, after all!</p>

<h3>Basically, </h3>
<p>this is my place, and if you don`t really like it, I`d kindly requerst you to move on from it. I may be open to critique and opinions in the future, but as I am now I am plenty happy just implementing my own ideas. That being said, if you're a close friend of mine, just ask first and I may listen! Bottom line is don't just show up and tell me what to change please. Haha.</p>
